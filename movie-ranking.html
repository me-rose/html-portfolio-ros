<hr />

<h3>N.1: Home Alone</h3>
<p>This is a family movie, christmas time, it is funny, dramatic, it gets you really involved in the story.</p>

<h3>N.2: My Girl</h3>
<p>Every time I watch this movie, I cry. It is so romantic and naive. A beuatiful teenager drama. How can you you ever forget your fisrt love? </p>

<h3>N.3: Limitless</h3>
<p>My favorite movies for many  reasons. It tackles politics, drugs, society, power, desire for power, how someone can get whatever they want. Simply fantastic. You'll be wondering where to find the substance to give you all the super power.</p>
